Clarke was actually living in Ceylon (not in India, or a tree), but the pair met, hit it off, and forged a story of technological progress and disaster (hello, HAL) thats steeped in humanity, in all its brilliance, weakness, courage and mad ambition. An audience of stoners, wowed by its eye-candy Star Gate sequence and pioneering visuals, adopted it as a pet movie. Were it not for them, 2001 might have faded into obscurity, but its hard to imagine it would have stayed there. Kubricks frighteningly clinical vision of the future  AI and all  still feels prophetic, more than 50 years on.Phil de Semlyen', 132, '2001: A Space Odyssey ', 1968, null) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

A monumental opening line (I believe in America) sets the operatic Mario Puzo adaptation in motion, before Coppolas epic morphs into a chilling dismantling of the American dream. The corruption-soaked story follows a powerful immigrant family grappling with the paradoxical values of reign and religion; those moral contradictions are crystallized in a legendary baptism sequence, superbly edited in parallel to the murdering of four rivaling dons. With countless iconic detailsa horses severed head, Marlon Brandos wheezy voice, Nino Rotas catchy waltzThe Godfathers authority lives on.Tomris Laffly', 175, 'The Godfather', 1972, null) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Elder sister Elsa has the magical power to conjure ice, so she creates a winter wonderland for her adoring little sister, Anna. But when Elsa accidentally hurts Anna with her magic, their royal parents decide to shutter Elsa away from the kingdom. The sisters grow up separate from society -- and each other ... a strategy that works until the king and queen die in a shipwreck and Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) must be crowned the new queen. During the coronation festivities, Anna (Kristen Bell) falls for visiting Prince Hans (Santino Fontana) who immediately proposes. But when they ask Elsa for her blessing, she scoffs, loses control of her powers, runs up a mountain, and sends the kingdom into an eternal winter. Feeling guilty, Anna sets out to find Elsa with the help of unlikely allies -- a loner ice harvester Kris', 102, 'Frozen', 2013, null) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
